bdd-with-gwen
=============

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to write an acceptance test suite using Gwen (https://github.com/shazam/gwen)

Gwen is a tiny library that facilitates the creation of clean, reusable and maintainable acceptance tests via the creation of a Domain Specific Language which describes the app under test. This repository is the companion to a live coding session which demonstrates how to create a new acceptance test suite from scratch and introduce concepts like a proper domain model, specification vs implementation and why they such things important when dealing with any platform.

install
=======

To build, install and run the acceptance tests and unit tests on the project, simply do a:

```
./gradlew test fork
```

on the root directory.
